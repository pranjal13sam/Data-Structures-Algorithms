//TIME COMPLEXITY:

Time complexity doesn't mean take taken by a machine to execute the code.

let's suppose i have 2 laptops, one laptop is macbook with latest windows and the other one is old windows laptop so it might happen that 
for a program to run the macbook might only take 1s to execute while on the other hand because of the older version the old laptop might 2s 
so this is the reason.

so what is TIME COMPLEXITY?
TIME COMPLEXITY means rate at which time taken increases with respect to input size.

//IMPORTANT:
.Time complexity should always be computed for worst case scenarios.
.Avoid constants 
.Avoid Lower Values




//SPACE COMPLEXITY:

space complexity=auxilary space + input space

what is auxilary space?
ex: a=b+c // so here we can see that a is the auxilary space because it is storing the value of b+c although it is not necessary
while  b and c are considered as input space.
